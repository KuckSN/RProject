#### What is MathX Recognizer

Mathematical Expression Recognizer (MathX Recognizer) is essentially a Machine Learning model trained to recognizes mathematical expression into text form that can be computed by computers.  
<br />

#### Training Machine Learning Model
Library "caret" is used to train our machine learning model and vectorized image data is fed into the machine learning model.
